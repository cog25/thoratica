## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a student (who wants to be a) developer!  
~~My contributions' count is small because I remove my repositories in a certain period.~~

### My Projects
 - [The NoIE License](https://github.com/thoratica/The-NoIE-License) - A license for world peace.
 - [blow.ga](https://github.com/thoratica/blow.ga) - An url shortener service.
 - [EntBlocks](https://github.com/thoratica/EntBlocks) - A project which adds my custom blocks to [Entry](https://playentry.org).
